# A11yBugs
## Projects to show bugs with accessibility

### Bug 1:
Project: AccessibilityIssuesBug1
* Enable talkback
* Open sample app on Pixel_API_28_64 (size matters more than the OS)
* Turn device to landscape (orientation doesn't matter, its just quicker to cover the screen this way)
* Use right swipe gesture to navigate down the screen.
* Once you have full scrolled swipe back.
* You cannot get to the Top view anymore as its collapse and doesn't expand.
